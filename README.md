# Codewars Solutions Repository

Welcome to my repository where I track all my solutions to tasks I've completed on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). This repository contains various solutions in programming languages specified in the [Languages Used](#languages-used) section for problems ranging from beginner to advanced difficulty.

## Table of Contents

- [Languages Used](#languages-used)
- [How to Use](#how-to-use)

## Languages Used

Here are some of the programming languages I've used and I will be using to solve Codewars challenges:

Current Language being used:

- TypeScript

Future Languages to be used:

- JavaScript
- Python
- SQL

Each solution file is named based on the KYU and the function name.

## How to Use

This repository is structured so that each folder corresponds to a specific programming language, and within each folder, you'll find subdirectories for each task or challenge I solved.

### Example Structure:

- TypeScript: /TypeScript /6kyu-problem_name.ts

Each file contains the solution to a specific problem, and I aim to include a brief description of the problem and the approach taken in the comments.

### Running the Solutions

To run any solution locally, ensure you have the appropriate environment set up for the language used.

- For TypeScript:

  ```bash

  cd TypeScript

  Copy each problem to the index.ts file

  Run:
  npm run typescript

  ```
